                <p class="text-xl text-justify">undefine =>undefined means avariable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.<br> undefined is a type by itself (undefined). Unassigned
                    variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined.
                <br><br>
                //demonstrating usage of undefined in javascript<br>
                var n;<br>
                <br><br>
                console.log(n);
                <br><br>
                //undefined<br>
                Here as the variable is declared but not assigned to any value, the variable by default is assigned a value of
                undefined.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    NULL =>  null is an object. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.<br>
                     JavaScript never sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically.<br>
                    
                    For example, when you do not know the value initially you can assign a null to a variable. Let’s see an example.<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    //demonstrating usage of null in javascript<br>
                    var n = null;<br>
                    
                    //later in your program<br>
                    <br>
                    n = array.slice(0, 2);<br>
                    <br>
                    //example
                    Here, in the example above, the variable n is given an initial value of null.<br> Later, in the program, the value of the
                    variable has been calculated from an expression.

                    <p class="text-2xl">Representational State Transfer, or REST, is the architectural style of the web, which allows communicating standards
                    between client and server. A client requests a resource, and a server will respond with the representation of that
                    resource that can be easily interpreted.</p><br><br>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl">What Is a REST API?</h3><br>
                    <p class="text-2xl">A REST API is a type of API that responds to a client’s request in a standardized representation, which is easy to
                    interpret because of the uniform interface of component constraints. The response format for REST comes in HTTP, which
                    can be JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP or plain text. Most developers use JSON format because
                    it is universal and supports any language for humans and machines to interpret.
                    
                    In a REST API, sometimes called RESTful API, a request must come through HTTP to a stateless protocol that does not
                    store clients’ information during the get request session. Each request is usually disparate and unrelated.</p>
